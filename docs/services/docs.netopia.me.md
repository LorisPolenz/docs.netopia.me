# Material MkDocs
This platform is based on [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org/) which lets one write content in the Markdown format. The content then is built into a regular HTML page, that looks good and consistent. 

For this specific page, a theme called [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) was used. The theme that is being used is called [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/mkdocs).

## Use cases for Netopia
Having a documentation platform which acts as a single source of truth for specific information and configurations is a huge benefit.
