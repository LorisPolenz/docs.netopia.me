# Welcome to the Netopia Docs

This page is dedicated to collecting information about the whole netopia.me space. 

## What is netopia.me?
Netopia.me is a domain that was created for the sole purpose to give infrastructure a suitable domain. 

This means that everything under the Netopia space is dedicated to IT-Infrastructure. If something is described as hosted on Netopia, it means that the service runs on infrastructure connected to the Netopia domain. Usually, the Service also has a netopa.me subdomain.

The name netopia.me was chosen because it is easy to remember, type and most importantly tell others. It's spelled like you say it (ne_topia.me).

## What is being hosted on Netopia?
Netopia will, at some point, contain all services that are accessible to the users of Netopia. 

The following is a non-complete list of services that run on Netopia.

* [Netopia Documentation Platform](https://docs.netopia.me){target="_blank"}
* [Platform as a Service](https://paas.netopia.me){target="_blank"}
* [Authentication Provider](https://sso.netopia.me){target="_blank"}
* [Automation Environment](https://automate.netopia.me){target="_blank"}

The idea is to constantly add more services to Netopia.
